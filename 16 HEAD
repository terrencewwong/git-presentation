git has a notion of the "current" state of the repo.
This is called the HEAD

The HEAD is a pointer to a head! (or a single commit)

In this case git will recognize it needs to update the
ref with the name 'master' when you make a commit.

-------------------------------------------------------

cat .git/HEAD

->

ref: refs/heads/master
